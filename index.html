  <p>Being a software engineer is not just about coding and building projects. It’s a massive ecosystem consisted of
    requirement analysis, designing, development, deploying, maintaining, etc.</p>
  <p>So it’s essential to automate things to reduce the time and focus on the development process’s core
    functionalities. We can use CI/CD tools to manage such situations easily.</p>
  <p>In this article, I’m planning to integrate the GitHub repo and AWS S3 bucket to automate the deployment of a React
    application using a CI/CD tool named <a href='https://buddy.works/'>Buddy</a>.</p>
  <p>Before that, let’s get a simple understanding of CI/CD tools.</p>
  <h3>What Are CI/CD Tools?</h3>
  <p>Continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment (CI/CD) have been used in the software
    development industry for a long period. CI/CD practices can contribute similarly in both infrastructure and
    internally developed applications. Many organizations use CI/CD tools to automate different phases of their
    application build.</p>
  <p>There are diverse Of CI/CD tools, but they all use closely related models. When choosing a CI/CD tool, you have to
    consider whether it is hosted or not, whether the UI is user friendly and simple to use, and whether it keeps up
    with Docker. An interesting fact is that CI/CD practices will help place you in a better position to guide your
    organization through this novel practice. Rather, you will be a guide for everyone else to follow.</p>
  <h3>Why I Chose Buddy</h3>
  <p>Recently, I came across this fantastic user-friendly CI/CD tool called Buddy that builds, tests, and deploys
    applications using code from GitLab, Bitbucket, and GitHub. It utilizes Docker containers with pre-installed
    languages and frameworks to build on, monitor, and notify actions. Buddy helps you to design delivery pipelines to
    build, test, and deploy your application on a single branch push. The pipelines comprise steps you can configure
    according to your requirements.</p>
  <p>In this article, let’s see how to deploy your React application to AWS S3 using Buddy. Here we go!</p>
  <h3>Task 1. Create a New IAM User Role in AWS</h3>
  <p>Log in to your AWS console, select IAM service, and then select Users. Then choose Add User, and you will be
    redirected to a UI like this where you can give a name to the new user. Select “Programmatic access” as the access
    type and continue to the permission section.</p>

  <p>In the permission section, select the “Attach existing plicies directly” tab and select “AmazonS3FullAccess” from
    the list below.</p>

  <p>After successfully creating a user, you will receive the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, which will be used
    later to make a connection between the CI/CD pipeline and AWS services. Make sure you download and save those IDs.

  <h4>Task 2. Create an S3 Bucket and Enable Static Site Hosting</h4>
  <p>This is a straightforward step. You just need to go to the S3 service using your AWS console and create a new
    bucket. Please make sure to remove the tick from “Block all public access”<strong> </strong>to make the bucket
    public.</p>

  </figcaption>
  <p>After creating the bucket, add the following plicy as a bucket plicy:</p>
  <pre>{
      “Version”: “2008–10–17”,
      “Statement”: 
              [
                 {
                   “Sid”: “AllowPublicRead”,
                   “Effect”: “Allow”,
                   “Principal”: 
                              {
                               “AWS”: “*”
                              },
                   “Action”: “s3:GetObject”,
                   “Resource”: “arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>/*”
                 }
               ]
}</pre>
  <p>As the final step of bucket creation, you need to go to the properties section to enable the static hosting option
    for your bucket. Once you are done, you will receive a URL for the bucket.</p>

  <h3>Task 3. Create a New Project/Select Your Git Repository</h3>
  <p>Next, if you haven’t yet, <a href='https://app.buddy.works/sign-up'>sign up with Buddy</a> or log in using your
    GitHub, Bitbucket, or Google account.</p>
  <p>Once you have logged in to your Buddy account, you can get started by creating a new project. You will be able to
    select your Git provider and repository in this stage. Once you finalize them, click the “Create a new project”
    button to confirm.</p>
  <p>Buddy allows you to connect with all the popular Git providers including GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, and private
    repositories with few clicks.</p>

  <h3>Task 4. Create a New Pipeline</h3>
  <p>To automate your React application, add a new delivery pipeline. Enter the pipeline name, trigger mode, and the
    branch from which Buddy will obtain your code. Then click the “Add a new pipeline” button to continue.</p>
  <p>“Branch allocation” is specifying the branch that Buddy will deploy from. If you adjust the trigger mode to “On
    push,” on each push to that branch, Buddy executes the pipeline.</p>
  <p>Considering trigger modes, Manual (on click) is recommended for production, “On push” (automatic) for development,
    and Recurrently (on time interval) for staging/testing.</p>

  <h3>Task 5. Add Actions</h3>
  <p>Next you should add a new action to the pipeline. Buddy facilitates several different approaches for deploying your
    project and lets you pick from hundreds of prespecified actions. I will add two actions in this scenario that will
    execute the following tasks:</p>
  <uli>Build the React app: download dependencies (npm, Yarn), compile assets.</uli>
  <uli>Deploy the React App to AWS S3</uli>
  <p>It is possible to manage React builds using the Node.js action. You can select the environment information and
    specify the commands to be executed.</p>
  <p>You can either use a single Node action to run all npm commands or use dedicated actions for each command. In this
    example, I will be using dedicated actions for each command.</p>
  <p>First, add an <code>npm install</code> command to make sure all your dependencies and libraries are in place for
    the build process.</p>

  </figure>
  </figcaption>
  <p>If you have any tests to run before deploying the project, Buddy provides options to run test automation using its
    pipeline easily. You can use another Node action to execute tests in your project using the relevant command. In my
    case, it's <code>npm run test</code>.</p>
  <p>Then add another Node action to execute the <code>npm run build</code> command to build the project.</p>
  <p>If you need to test those commands, you can simply run the pipeline manually before moving on to the next steps. If
    there are any errors, you can find them in action logs.</p>

  <p>Configure AWS integration and enter the name of your integration. Paste the Access Key Id and Secret Access Key
    from the AWS console that you copied. Click on the “Add integration” button.</p>

  </figcaption>
  <p>Then configure action information, choose the Bucket ID you want to upload your files to. Set the “Source path” to
    “/build”<strong> <strong> </strong> </strong>since your project build directory id is “source/build.” Also, make
    sure that you have selected Pipeline Filesystem as the source since you build the project using the pipeline in the
    previous action. Finally, click on the “Add this action” button.</p>

  </figcaption>
  <p>Now your pipeline is all set to deploy your React application to AWS S3.</p>
  <p>What if you want to get notifications about the deployment? Buddy has an answer for that too.</p>
  <p>Scroll down and move to Notifications. From the right-hand side of the page, select the service of your choice.
    I’ll choose Slack, a popular notification service among Buddy users. As you’re adding a third-party service to your
    pipeline, you will need to configure integration details. Here you can decide the scope of the integration.</p>

  <p>Finally, you have to accept the OAuth permissions of the chosen application:</p>

    <figcaption></img>
  </figure>
  </figcaption>
  <p>Then you can specify the notification message as your wish.</p>

    <figcaption></img>
  </figure>
  </figcaption>
  <p>Once someone pushes changes to your Git repository and executes the pipeline, you will be notified.</p>

  <h3>Task 6. Run the Pipeline</h3>
  <p>Once you push changes to your Git repository, your pipeline will execute and deploy your React application to AWS
    S3.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Automation has become a necessity to escape from the complexities of the modern software development process. CI/CD
    tools make it possible to efficiently deliver the applications with new, enriched features to the users. Tools like
    Buddy assist us in this role, allowing developers to build pipelines to perform actions for a wide variety of
    technologies and integrate them to address the most unique and essential needs.</p>
